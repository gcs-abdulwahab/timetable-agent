## Verification Checklist

### ‚úÖ Teacher Conflicts
- [ ] Teacher conflict shows both subjects with semester information
- [ ] Format matches: `"Subject A (Semester 1) on Monday, Subject B (Semester 3) on Wednesday"`
- [ ] Cross-semester conflicts are detected correctly

### ‚úÖ Room Conflicts  
- [ ] Room conflict shows subject, semester, and teacher information
- [ ] Format matches: `"Subject C (Semester 5) - Dr. Jane Doe on Tuesday"`
- [ ] Multiple entries show comma-separated format

### ‚úÖ Unknown Semester Fallback
- [ ] Entries with non-existent semesters show "Unknown Semester"
- [ ] Format matches: `"Test Subject (Unknown Semester) on Friday"`

### ‚úÖ UI Elements
- [ ] Red conflict warning button appears when conflicts exist
- [ ] Conflict count is displayed correctly
- [ ] Popup opens when conflict button is clicked
- [ ] Conflicts are categorized as "Teacher Conflict" or "Room Conflict"
- [ ] Time slot and day information is displayed

## Additional Test Scenarios

### Cross-Semester Detection
The conflict detection should identify conflicts where:
- Same teacher scheduled in different semesters at overlapping times
- Same room booked across different semesters at same time slots

### Message Format Requirements
- **Teacher conflicts**: Should show all conflicting subjects with their semesters and days
- **Room conflicts**: Should show subject, semester, teacher name, and day for each conflict
- **Fallback**: Unknown semesters should gracefully display "Unknown Semester"

## Troubleshooting

### If conflicts don't appear:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify data is loading correctly in the Network tab
3. Check that conflict detection is working by looking at existing conflicts

### If message format is incorrect:
1. Check `conflictChecker.ts` implementation
2. Verify subject, semester, and teacher data is properly linked
3. Test with browser developer tools to inspect conflict data

## Expected Results Summary

After completing the QA testing, you should observe:

1. **Teacher conflicts** display comprehensive information about overlapping schedules across semesters
2. **Room conflicts** show detailed booking information with teacher names
3. **Fallback behavior** gracefully handles missing semester data
4. **UI elements** clearly present conflict information to users
