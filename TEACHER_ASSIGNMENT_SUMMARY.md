# Teacher Assignment System - Step 5 Complete

## Overview

The Teacher Assignment System has successfully completed Step 5: **Select and assign teachers**. This system intelligently assigns teachers to subjects while respecting constraints and optimizing for department expertise and load balancing.

## System Features

### ‚úÖ Core Functionality

1. **Existing Mapping Preservation**: Respects existing teacher-subject assignments from `data/allocations.json`
2. **Department-First Assignment**: Prioritizes teachers from the subject's own department
3. **Load Balancing**: Distributes teaching loads evenly across faculty
4. **Constraint Checking**: Prevents double-booking and over-assignment
5. **Placeholder Generation**: Creates "TBA - Department" entries when no teacher is available

### ‚úÖ Assignment Logic

The system uses a sophisticated scoring algorithm that considers:
- **Department Match** (100 points): Teachers from the same department as the subject
- **Load Balancing** (up to 50 points): Prefer teachers with lower current workload
- **Specialization** (up to 30 points): Prefer teachers with fewer diverse subjects
- **Seniority** (10-20 points): Give preference to Professors and HODs

## Assignment Results

### üìä Summary Statistics

- **Total Subjects**: 323
- **Successfully Assigned**: 323 (100%)
- **Placeholders Needed**: 0
- **Teachers Utilized**: 134 out of 170 available
- **Departments Covered**: 17 departments
- **Assignment Method**: All assignments made via department matching

### üèÜ Top Loaded Teachers

1. **Abdul Wahab** (CS Dept): 9 assignments, 6 unique subjects
2. **Sadaf Siddique** (CS Dept): 8 assignments, 6 unique subjects  
3. **Dr. Muhammad Ghous** (Geography): 8 assignments, 8 unique subjects
4. **Dr. Mukhtar Hussain Shah** (Botany): 8 assignments, 8 unique subjects
5. **Nasira Perveen** (Botany): 8 assignments, 8 unique subjects

### üè¢ Department Distribution

Top departments by subject count:
- **Computer Science (d6)**: 26 subjects
- **Zoology (d16)**: 26 subjects  
- **Botany (d22)**: 23 subjects
- **Chemistry (d2)**: 23 subjects
- **Biotechnology (d1)**: 21 subjects

## Generated Files

### 1. `data/teacher-subject-mappings.json`
Complete detailed assignment data including:
- Full assignment details with teacher names and reasons
- Teacher workload summaries  
- Validation results
- Assignment metadata

### 2. `data/subject-teacher-map.json`
Simplified mapping for timetable use:
```json
{
  "subjectTeacherMap": {
    "BT-101": "t73",
    "BCBT-101": "t74",
    "CS-101": "t2",
    ...
  }
}
```

## Constraint Compliance

### ‚úÖ Validation Results
- **No Double-Booking**: No teacher assigned to conflicting time slots
- **Load Limits**: No teacher exceeds 8 subjects maximum
- **Department Coverage**: All departments have appropriate teacher coverage
- **Existing Assignments**: All pre-existing allocations preserved

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Assignment System

```bash
# Run complete teacher assignment
node scripts/teacher-assignment-system.js

# Generate simplified subject‚Üíteacher mapping
node scripts/create-subject-teacher-map.js
```

### Integration Points

The system integrates with:
- **Existing Allocations**: Reads from `data/allocations.json`
- **Teacher Database**: Uses `data/teachers.json` 
- **Subject Database**: Uses `data/subjects.json`
- **Department Database**: Uses `data/departments.json`

## Assignment Algorithms

### Load Balancing Strategy
- Tracks total assignments and unique subjects per teacher
- Prevents overloading any single faculty member
- Distributes workload across available department faculty

### Conflict Prevention
- Checks day-period slot conflicts
- Validates against maximum subject limits
- Ensures no teacher double-booking

### Expertise Matching
- Prioritizes same-department assignments
- Considers teaching department specifications
- Uses designation (Professor, HOD) as quality indicator

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements
1. **Subject Expertise Metadata**: Add specific subject expertise tags to teachers
2. **Time Preference**: Consider teacher time slot preferences
3. **Cross-Department Rules**: More sophisticated inter-department assignment rules
4. **Workload Balancing**: More granular credit hour-based load balancing

## Files Created

- `app/lib/teacherAssignment.ts` - TypeScript implementation (for Next.js integration)
- `scripts/teacher-assignment-system.js` - Standalone JavaScript implementation  
- `scripts/create-subject-teacher-map.js` - Mapping generator utility
- `data/teacher-subject-mappings.json` - Complete assignment results
- `data/subject-teacher-map.json` - Simplified subject‚Üíteacher mapping

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Main `TeacherAssignmentSystem` class
- **Functional Utilities**: Standalone functions for specific operations
- **Data Persistence**: JSON file storage for results
- **Validation System**: Built-in constraint checking

### Performance
- **Efficient Processing**: Handles 323 subjects and 170 teachers instantly
- **Memory Optimized**: Uses Maps for fast lookups
- **Scalable Design**: Can handle larger datasets
