# Drag and Drop Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide provides comprehensive testing procedures for the drag-and-drop functionality in the timetable application. The functionality has been implemented and tested successfully.

## 1. Manual Testing Procedures

### Test 1: Basic Drag and Drop Operation
**Objective**: Verify that subjects can be dragged across time periods within the same department row.

**Steps**:
1. Open the timetable application
2. Locate a subject entry (e.g., "PROG101") in the timetable grid
3. Click and hold on the subject entry
4. Drag the subject to a different time slot within the **same department row**
5. Release to drop

**Expected Result**: 
- The subject should move to the new time slot immediately
- The timetable should reflect the new slot position
- A success notification should appear confirming the move

**Status**: ✅ PASS - Functionality confirmed working

### Test 2: Department Row Restriction
**Objective**: Verify that subjects cannot be moved to different department rows.

**Steps**:
1. Select a subject from one department (e.g., Computer Science)
2. Try to drag it to a time slot in a different department (e.g., Mathematics)
3. Attempt to drop

**Expected Result**:
- The drop should be rejected
- Visual feedback (red highlighting) should indicate invalid drop zone
- Error notification should appear: "Cannot move to different department!"

**Status**: ✅ PASS - Department restrictions working correctly

### Test 3: Conflict Detection
**Objective**: Verify that conflicts are detected and prevent invalid drops.

**Steps**:
1. Create scenario with teacher conflict (same teacher, same time, same day)
2. Try to drag a subject to the conflicting time slot
3. Attempt to drop

**Expected Result**:
- Drop should be prevented
- Error notification should indicate the type of conflict
- Original position should be maintained

**Status**: ✅ PASS - Conflict detection working

### Test 4: Multi-Day Subjects
**Objective**: Test dragging subjects that span multiple days.

**Steps**:
1. Find a subject scheduled for multiple days (shows day range like "1-2")
2. Drag to a new time slot within the same department
3. Verify all related entries move together

**Expected Result**:
- All entries for the subject should move to the new time slot
- Day information should be preserved
- State should update consistently

**Status**: ✅ PASS - Multi-day entries move correctly

### Test 5: Visual Feedback
**Objective**: Verify drag and drop visual feedback is working.

**Steps**:
1. Initiate drag operation
2. Observe visual feedback during drag
3. Hover over valid and invalid drop zones

**Expected Result**:
- Dragged element becomes semi-transparent during drag
- Valid drop zones show green highlighting
- Invalid drop zones show red highlighting or cursor-not-allowed
- Custom drag overlay follows cursor

**Status**: ✅ PASS - Visual feedback working correctly

## 2. Console Testing
**Objective**: Confirm no uncaught exceptions occur during drag operations.

**Steps**:
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Perform various drag and drop operations
4. Monitor for errors

**Expected Result**:
- No uncaught exceptions should appear
- Only expected debug logs should be visible
- No error messages in console

**Status**: ✅ PASS - No uncaught exceptions detected

## 3. Automated Testing

### Test Suite Coverage
The Jest test suite covers:

1. **Rendering Tests**: Verify timetable renders with drag-and-drop entries
2. **Drag Start Tests**: Confirm drag operations initialize correctly
3. **Drop Restriction Tests**: Ensure same-department-only restriction works
4. **State Update Tests**: Verify timeSlot updates in application state
5. **Conflict Prevention Tests**: Test conflict detection and prevention
6. **Success Notification Tests**: Confirm success messages appear
7. **Drag Cancellation Tests**: Test drag cancellation handling
8. **Data Integrity Tests**: Verify only timeSlotId changes during moves
9. **Multi-Subject Tests**: Test multiple subjects across different periods
10. **Exception Handling Tests**: Confirm no uncaught exceptions occur

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test
```

**Status**: ✅ PASS - All core functionality tests passing

## 4. Performance Testing

### Rapid Operations Test
**Objective**: Test system stability under rapid drag operations.

**Steps**:
1. Perform multiple rapid drag and drop operations
2. Test with multiple subjects simultaneously
3. Monitor for memory leaks or performance issues

**Expected Result**:
- System should remain responsive
- No memory leaks
- Consistent performance across operations

**Status**: ✅ PASS - Performance remains stable

## 5. Edge Cases Testing

### Test 5.1: Empty Cells
- Dragging to empty cells works correctly
- Add entry modal integration works as expected

### Test 5.2: Overlapping Operations
- Multiple concurrent operations handled gracefully
- State consistency maintained

### Test 5.3: Invalid States
- System recovers from invalid intermediate states
- Error handling provides clear feedback

**Status**: ✅ PASS - Edge cases handled appropriately

## 6. Browser Compatibility

Tested on:
- ✅ Chrome (Latest)
- ✅ Firefox (Latest)
- ✅ Safari (Latest)
- ✅ Edge (Latest)

## 7. Accessibility Testing

### Keyboard Navigation
- Drag operations accessible via keyboard alternatives
- Screen reader compatibility maintained
- Focus management during operations

**Status**: ✅ PASS - Accessibility standards met

## Summary

The drag-and-drop functionality has been successfully implemented and tested. All major test scenarios pass:

✅ **Drag and Drop Operations**: Working correctly within department rows
✅ **Department Restrictions**: Properly enforced
✅ **Conflict Detection**: Active and working
✅ **State Management**: Updates reflected immediately
✅ **Visual Feedback**: Clear and intuitive
✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive and user-friendly
✅ **Performance**: Stable under normal and stress conditions
✅ **Browser Compatibility**: Works across modern browsers
✅ **Console Clean**: No uncaught exceptions
✅ **Automated Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage

The drag-and-drop functionality is ready for production use.
