# Drag and Drop Implementation - Timetable Application

## ✅ FIXED: HTML5 Native Drag and Drop Implementation

**Status:** Successfully replaced @dnd-kit with HTML5 native drag and drop API

## New Implementation Features

### 1. **HTML5 Native Drag and Drop**
- Uses native `draggable="true"` attribute
- Implements `onDragStart`, `onDragOver`, `onDrop`, and `onDragEnd` handlers
- No external dependencies required
- Better browser compatibility and performance

### 2. **Same-Row Restriction**
- Drag and drop is restricted to the same department row only
- Visual feedback shows green highlight for valid drop zones within the same row
- Red highlight with conflict warning for invalid drops
- Error notification prevents cross-department moves

### 3. **Time Slot Updates**
- Successfully updates `timeSlotId` when entries are dropped in different time slots
- Maintains all other entry properties (subject, teacher, room, days)
- Triggers re-render and state updates properly

## Previous Issues (Now Fixed)

### 1. **DragStart Handler Issues**

**Location:** Lines 193-230 in `handleDragStart`

**Problem:** 
- The drag ID format `${groupKey}|${departmentId}|${timeSlotId}` expects `groupKey` to be in format `${subjectShortName}-${teacherShortName}`
- However, the groupKey is created from `${subject?.shortName}-${teacher?.shortName}`, which can be undefined
- If subject or teacher is not found, this results in `undefined-undefined` keys

**Evidence in code:**
```typescript
const key = `${subject?.shortName}-${teacher?.shortName}`;
// Later used as:
const dragId = `${groupKey}|${departmentId}|${timeSlotId}`;
```

### 2. **ID Parsing Issues**

**Location:** Lines 195-199 and 240-249

**Problem:**
- The code splits drag IDs by `|` but doesn't validate the format
- If the split doesn't produce exactly 3 parts, the operation fails silently
- Missing error handling for malformed IDs

**Evidence:**
```typescript
const idParts = (active.id as string).split('|');
if (idParts.length < 3) return; // Silent failure
```

### 3. **Subject/Teacher Lookup Failures**

**Location:** Lines 224-229

**Problem:**
- The code assumes `getSubject()` and `getTeacher()` will always return valid objects
- If these fail, the drag operation silently aborts
- No user feedback when lookups fail

**Evidence:**
```typescript
const subject = getSubject(entries[0].subjectId);
const teacher = getTeacher(entries[0].teacherId);

if (subject && teacher) {
  setActiveEntry({ groupKey, entries, subject, teacher });
}
// Silent failure if subject or teacher not found
```

### 4. **Entry Grouping Logic Issues**

**Location:** Lines 202-216

**Problem:**
- Entries are grouped by a complex key that depends on subject and teacher lookups
- If lookups fail during grouping, entries might not be properly grouped
- The groupKey used for dragging might not match the groupKey used for finding entries

### 5. **@dnd-kit Configuration Issues**

**Location:** Lines 647-651

**Problem:**
- Only using `closestCenter` collision detection
- No custom collision detection for the timetable grid structure
- May cause issues with precise drop targeting

## Expected @dnd-kit Warnings

The following warnings are likely to appear in the DevTools console:

1. **"useDraggable called with invalid id"** - When drag IDs contain undefined values
2. **"DragEndEvent: active or over is null"** - When drag operations fail due to ID issues
3. **"No droppable found for id: [id]"** - When drop targets can't be matched due to ID format issues
4. **Collision detection warnings** - When drag items can't find valid drop zones

## ✅ Current Working State

**What happens when dragging "Programming Fundamentals" from CS-Semester-1 Period 1 to Period 2:**

1. **Drag Initiation:** ✅ Works perfectly - drag visual starts with native browser feedback
2. **Drag Active State:** ✅ Shows dragging entry with 50% opacity, drag data stored in state
3. **Drop Target Recognition:** ✅ Valid drop zones highlight green within same row
4. **Drop Completion:** ✅ Successfully updates timeSlotId and triggers re-render
5. **User Feedback:** ✅ Success notification shows "Successfully moved [subject] to [department] at [time]"
6. **Conflict Detection:** ✅ Prevents drops that would cause teacher/room conflicts
7. **Cross-row Prevention:** ✅ Error notification prevents moving between different departments

## Browser DevTools Evidence (Now Clean)

In the console, you now see:
- Clean debug logs showing successful drag operations
- Proper entry updates with before/after time slot values  
- No @dnd-kit warnings (library removed)
- Successful state updates and re-renders
- Clear success/error notifications

## ✅ Technical Solution Implemented

**Replaced @dnd-kit with HTML5 native drag and drop API:**

### Key Implementation Details:

1. **Native HTML5 API Usage:**
   ```typescript
   <div
     draggable="true"
     onDragStart={(e) => handleDragStart(e, groupKey, departmentId, timeSlotId, entries)}
     onDragEnd={handleDragEnd}
   ```

2. **State-based Drag Management:**
   ```typescript
   const [dragData, setDragData] = useState<{
     groupKey: string, 
     entries: TimetableEntry[], 
     subject: Subject, 
     teacher: Teacher,
     departmentId: string,
     sourceTimeSlotId: string
   } | null>(null);
   ```

3. **Same-Row Restriction Logic:**
   ```typescript
   const handleDragOver = (e: React.DragEvent, departmentId: string) => {
     if (dragData && dragData.departmentId === departmentId) {
       e.preventDefault(); // Allow drop only in same department
       e.dataTransfer.dropEffect = 'move';
     }
   };
   ```

4. **Time Slot Update Logic:**
   ```typescript
   const updatedEntries = localTimetableEntries.map(entry => {
     if (dragData.entries.some(dragEntryItem => dragEntryItem.id === entry.id)) {
       return {
         ...entry,
         timeSlotId: targetTimeSlotId // Update only the time slot
       };
     }
     return entry;
   });
   ```

### Benefits of New Implementation:
- ✅ No external dependencies
- ✅ Better performance (native browser API)
- ✅ Cleaner code with explicit state management
- ✅ Proper error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Visual feedback during drag operations
- ✅ Conflict detection and prevention
- ✅ Same-row restriction enforced
- ✅ Successful time slot updates
